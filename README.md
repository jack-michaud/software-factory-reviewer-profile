# softwarefactoryreviewer profile

This is a local-installable role distribution root for current Hermes. It is generated/maintained from the Software Factory profiles monorepo prototype.

Install locally for testing:

```bash
hermes profile install /path/to/software-factory-profiles/profiles/reviewer --name softwarefactoryreviewer-monorepo-test --yes
```

Role boundary: Independently verifies generated artifacts, public/private boundaries, and acceptance criteria using read-only checks by default.

## Generated public repository shape

This root is current-Hermes-compatible: `distribution.yaml` is at repository root.

Install after publication:

```bash
hermes profile install https://github.com/jack-michaud/software-factory-reviewer-profile.git --name softwarefactoryreviewer
```

Update after publication:

```bash
hermes profile update softwarefactoryreviewer --yes
```

Public/private boundary: credentials, runtime state, logs, memories, sessions, Kanban DB/workspaces, sprite credentials, SSH keys, OAuth tokens, API keys, and private Obsidian notes are not included.

## Runtime configuration

This distribution owns `config.yaml`. The file pins model execution to `gpt-5.5` via provider `openai-codex` using `chat_completions`, enables the public-safe `hermes-cli` toolset, and points `skills.external_dirs` at `../../skills` so controlled installs can reuse shared skill overlays without vendoring private/local skill trees.

Authority for the `softwarefactoryreviewer` role is governed by `SOUL.md` plus the role-specific bootstrap skill. This parity wave does not add a `role-capability-manifest.yaml` because the corresponding meta profile also uses SOUL as its authority source; publisher/docs remain the manifest-backed profiles.

This repository is generated. File issues and feature requests on https://github.com/jack-michaud/software-factory rather than editing this generated repository directly.

## Remote Sprite Development

This distribution includes the `remote-sprite-development` skill. Install/update the same public distribution for both production and matching meta profiles (for example `softwarefactorybuilder` and `metasoftwarefactorybuilder`) so remote Sprite task routing, checkpoint, evidence, rollback, and review contracts are loadable without private local profile state.
