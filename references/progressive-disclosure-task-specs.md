# Progressive-disclosure Kanban task specs

Use this reference when a Software Factory role creates, decomposes, reviews, publishes, installs, validates, or documents Kanban task specs. Root `SOUL.md` and root profile instructions should stay concise: keep role identity, authority boundaries, public/private rules, and a short context map there, then route detailed task-writing guidance to references or focused skills with explicit `When X, read Y` triggers.

## Required task shape

Software Factory PM/Kanban task specs should contain:

1. **Title** — imperative and specific enough to identify the intended outcome.
2. **Goal** — one or two sentences explaining the outcome and why it matters.
3. **Context index** — an always-read line plus trigger-routed optional context, using explicit `When X, read Y` wording. Include parent task ids, source maps, skills, reference files, and validation artifacts only when relevant.
4. **Scope** — separate `In` and `Out` boundaries so the assignee knows what authority is granted and what must be left to a follow-up task.
5. **Acceptance criteria** — independent, objectively verifiable criteria that define done.
6. **Evidence expectations** — for each non-trivial criterion, name the proof expected in the handoff: command output, artifact path, source path, diff hunk/snippet, screenshot, public URL, reviewer verdict, Kanban task id, or generated manifest.

## Acceptance-criteria quality bar

Acceptance criteria must be:

- **Clear and concise** — plain language with no ambiguous adjectives unless paired with a threshold.
- **Testable / objectively verifiable** — a reviewer or automated check can decide pass/fail from evidence.
- **Outcome-focused** — describe user/system behavior or delivered artifacts, not internal implementation steps unless the implementation choice is itself required.
- **Measurable where possible** — use paths, counts, target profile lists, command names, URLs, status codes, or other thresholds instead of words like "better" or "complete".
- **Independent** — each criterion should stand alone enough that failures are diagnosable.
- **Stakeholder-readable** — PM, builder, reviewer, publisher, docs, and installer roles should interpret the criterion the same way.
- **Evidence-linked** — every non-trivial criterion should include `Evidence:` or otherwise state the expected proof.

If a criterion cannot be proven with public-safe evidence, rewrite it before dispatch or mark the task blocked with the smallest decision needed.

## Progressive context rules

- Keep non-negotiables in the always-read layer: safety boundaries, task contract, authority limits, escalation/blocking rules, and acceptance criteria.
- Put deeper doctrine, examples, prior research, source maps, and validation checklists in linked references or focused skills.
- Use compact pyramid summaries for large backlog/research inputs: short root summary first, then grouped details with links or artifact paths.
- Require handoffs to state which context was used so routing misses are debuggable.
- Do not copy private runtime state, raw Kanban databases/workspaces, logs, sessions, memories, credentials, or local profile state into task specs or evidence.

## Role routing

- PM: use this reference whenever drafting, decomposing, or linking Kanban tasks.
- Orchestrator: use this reference when turning goals into durable task graphs or checking dependency shapes.
- Reviewer: use this reference when verifying task-spec quality, evidence coverage, and root-file compactness.
- Builder: use this reference when creating scoped follow-up tasks from implementation findings or when reporting evidence against acceptance criteria.
- Publisher: use this reference when release/publication tasks need gated dependencies, proof of approval, or source/push evidence.
- Docs: use this reference when transforming release packets into docs tasks or documenting public-safe workflow expectations.
